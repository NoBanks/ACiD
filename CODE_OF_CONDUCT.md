# Code of Conduct

## Keep It Simple

1. **Don't be an asshole**
2. **Help others when you can**
3. **Assume good intent**

That's it. That's the code of conduct.

## Expanded (If You Need It)

### Be Chill

- Disagreements are fine. Attacks aren't.
- Critique code, not people.
- If someone's new, help them. You were new once.

### Stay Focused

- We're here to build ACiD
- Drama, politics, tribalism — take it elsewhere
- No shilling other projects in our spaces

### Respect the Vibe

- We're a meme that works
- Keep energy high, ego low
- Celebrate wins, learn from losses

---

## Enforcement

If someone's being a problem:

1. First time: Friendly reminder
2. Second time: Timeout
3. Third time: Gone

We're not building a bureaucracy. Bad actors get removed. Good actors get celebrated.
