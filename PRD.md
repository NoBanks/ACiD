# ACiD - Product Requirements Document

## One-Liner

An L2 that exists because Base exists. That's it. That's the pitch.

---

## Philosophy

This is not a venture-backed moonshot. This is a side project by crypto OGs who've been around since 2017 and know that the best projects:

- Ship first, hype never
- Underpromise, occasionally deliver
- Let the work speak
- Don't take themselves seriously

---

## Founder Background

Nearly **30 years** in art creation, curation, and production:

- Full production cinematography
- Songwriting, arrangement, recording
- Mixing, mastering
- Visual art and design
- Breaking things. Going against the grain.

**Artist through and through.** Now building in web3.

This isn't a tech bro launching another L2. This is an artist who learned to code, building infrastructure that reflects both disciplines.

---

## Code-First, Visually Minded

**Core belief:** Code is just 1s and 0s if it doesn't have visual uniqueness to it.

When I first learned to code, it felt cold and sterile. No life. No soul. I had to learn to customize my environment - themes, fonts, layouts - before I could build with joy. Once the visual experience matched my creative standards, building became better.

**This is ACiD's approach:**

- The chain works (code-first)
- But everything you see and touch should inspire (visually minded)
- Explorer UI that doesn't look like every other Blockscout fork
- Bridge experience that feels intentional
- Documentation that's a pleasure to read
- Developer tools that spark creativity

**The thesis:** Web3 has incredible builders who lack visual inspiration. If they were more visually inspired, they'd be happier building. Happy builders build better. Better builders make better products for everyone.

ACiD isn't just an L2. It's a statement: **infrastructure can have soul.**

**Anyone can build on ACiD.**

The founder isn't the chain. The founder just launched the idea. ACiD is permissionless — for builders, creators, degens, agents, anyone. No gatekeepers. No permission needed. Just build.

**We are not promising:**
- Revolutionary technology (it's a fork)
- Token price appreciation (there might not even be a token)
- Changing the world
- Being better than Base

**We are promising:**
- A working L2
- The joke will land
- It'll be fun to build

---

## Why This Works

1. **Anti-Coinbase sentiment is free marketing** - We don't create it, we just exist as the punchline
2. **Meme positioning is armor** - Can't fail expectations you never set
3. **The tech is proven** - OP Stack runs billions in TVL. We're not inventing anything
4. **Self-selecting community** - People who bridge to a chain called ACID? Those are our people

---

## The Name (It's Doing A Lot)

```
A C i D
│ │ │ │
│ │ │ └── Development
│ │ └──── intelligence (the seeing eye 👁 / the droplet 💧)
│ └────── Crypto
└──────── Artificial
```

The lowercase `i` is intentional:
- **The seeing eye** — awareness, not a dullard crypto user
- **The droplet** — a single drop, IYKYK
- **AI** — intelligence is literally in the name

**Official backronym (when you need one):**
> **A**rtificial **C**rypto **i**ntelligence **D**evelopment

**Payment meme potential:**
If $ACID becomes the native currency, merchants literally ask customers: "Do you take ACID?"

That's not marketing. That's a cultural moment.

Use this for: press, serious convos, grant applications, "what does ACID stand for?"

Use the meme for: everything else

**Three audiences, one name:**
| Layer | Meaning | Narrative |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| pH | Base counter | Crypto twitter meme |
| Psychedelics | Counter-culture | Anti-establishment crowd |
| AI | "AI" in ACID | AI x Crypto thesis |

**This isn't an accident, it's positioning.**

Founder is an AI expert. AI-native features aren't buzzwords here - they're roadmap (if we had one).

## The Thesis (x402 Era)

We're entering the agentic finance era. AI agents need rails to transact autonomously.

**Base vs ACID - not competition, coexistence:**

| | Base | ACID |
|--|------|------|
| Vibe | Corporate | Alternative |
| Backed by | Coinbase (public company) | Anons who get it |
| Optimized for | Human users | AI agents + humans |
| Compliance | Regulatory-friendly | Permissionless |
| Brand | Professional | Meme with substance |

**We're not saying we're better. We're saying we're different.**

Base is great for:
- Institutional adoption
- Regulatory clarity
- Coinbase ecosystem integration
- Normie onboarding

ACID is for:
- AI agent infrastructure
- Autonomous transactions (x402)
- People who want alternatives
- Builders who don't need permission

**The future has room for both.** Acids and bases coexist in nature. They balance each other. That's the whole point.

---

## The Balance Thesis

Just like pH needs balance, so does web3.

**If you're pro-Base, you should be pro-ACiD.** Not because we're competitors — because balance requires both. A world with only Base is pH 14. That's not balanced. That's caustic.

We appreciate everything Base has built. Coinbase brought millions into crypto. Base is solid infrastructure. We're not here to tear that down. We're here to complete the equation.

**For Base maxis:** Supporting ACiD isn't betrayal. It's chemistry. You can't have balance with only one side of the scale.

**For ACiD holders:** We root for Base. When they win, the ecosystem wins. When they ship, we celebrate. No tribalism. Just equilibrium.

```
pH 1  ←───────── 7 ─────────→  pH 14
ACiD            neutral           Base
     ←── both needed for balance ──→
```

**The ask:** Don't pick sides. Pick balance. The healthiest systems have both acids and bases working together.

This isn't competition. It's coexistence. It's chemistry. It's how nature works.

## Minimal Launch Strategy

### What We Ship

```
Week 1-2: Fork OP Stack, get local devnet running
Week 3-4: Deploy testnet on Sepolia
Week 5-6: Basic bridge UI, block explorer
Week 7:   Launch tweet
```

### What We Don't Do

- No whitepaper
- No roadmap promises
- No "partnerships" announcements
- No Discord (Telegram only, less noise)
- No tokenomics docs (figure it out later or never)
- No influencer outreach
- No VC conversations

### Launch Day

**Twitter account**: `@pHbalanceweb3`

The thesis is in the handle. pH balance + web3. Says it all.

**Bio options**:
- `ACiD`
- `< 7`
- `Don't trip, we have no roadmap.`

**First tweet**:
```
gm

Base exists.
nature demands equilibrium.

bridge open: [link]
```

**Backup bangers for later:**
- "Don't trip, we have no roadmap."
- "Expand your portfolio. Expand your mind."
- "The only L2 your government warned you about."
- "First one's free." (for testnet)
- "Set and setting: Sepolia, then mainnet."
- "You don't drop Base. Just sayin."

**On "competition":**
We root for Base. Seriously. They're doing great work. The ecosystem needs corporate-friendly rails. We're just the alternative for people who want something different. No war. No drama. Just balance.

When Base wins, say congrats. When they ship, say nice. Kill the adversarial crypto playbook. That shit is tired.

**That's the launch.** No thread. No announcement post. Let people discover it.

## Tech Stack (Keep It Simple)

| Component | What We Use | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Rollup Framework | OP Stack (Bedrock) | Battle-tested, same as Base |
| Execution | op-geth | EVM compatible, no changes needed |
| Sequencer | Single operator (us) | Decentralize later if it matters |
| Bridge | Standard OP bridge | Don't reinvent the wheel |
| Explorer | Blockscout | Open source, works fine |
| RPC | Self-hosted initially | Alchemy/QuickNode later if needed |

**Modifications from vanilla OP Stack:**
- Chain ID
- Branding/naming
- That's basically it

---

## Team

**Ideal: 2-3 people who get it**

| Role | Type | Vibe |
|------|------|------|
| Protocol Dev | Part-time | Can run OP Stack, knows Go |
| Frontend Dev | Part-time | Can ship a bridge UI that doesn't suck |
| Ops Person | You (founder) | Tweets, handles infra, keeps it alive |

**Not needed:**
- Marketing person (the meme IS the marketing)
- Community manager (let it grow organic)
- Tokenomics "expert"
- Advisory board

---

## Budget (Minimal)

| Item | Monthly | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Sequencer server | $200-500 | Single node to start |
| RPC nodes | $200-400 | Can use free tiers initially |
| L1 gas (batch posting) | $2-5K | Depends on activity |
| Domain + hosting | $50 | Basic stuff |
| **Total burn** | **~$3-6K/month** | Before any real traction |

**No need for:**
- $200K audits (it's a fork of audited code)
- $500K grants program (let organic demand prove need)
- Marketing budget (meme is free)

**If it takes off**, revisit. Until then, keep it lean.

---

## Revenue Model (Eventually, Maybe)

Sequencer fees go to the operator (us). On Base this is millions/year.

**Options:**
1. Keep it and fund development
2. Share with builders (differentiator)
3. Burn it (deflationary meme)
4. DAO treasury (if we ever go there)

**Decision: Later.** Don't optimize for revenue on a project that might have 12 users.

---

## What Success Looks Like

**Minimum viable success:**
- Bridge works
- People can deploy contracts
- The joke lands on Twitter
- We had fun building it

**Surprise success:**
- $1M TVL
- Base acknowledges our existence
- Vitalik tweets the pH joke

**Meme success:**
- $ACiD becomes a recognized currency
- "ACID vs BASE" becomes a narrative
- We trend for a day
- Merchants asking "Do you take ACID?" becomes a thing
- People paying for stuff in $ACiD IRL

---

## Risks (Honest Assessment)

| Risk | Reality Check |
|------|---------------|
| Nobody uses it | Probably. That's fine. |
| Sequencer costs exceed revenue | Cap TVL, turn it off, or find sponsors |
| Security issues | It's OP Stack. If it's broken, Base is broken too |
| Legal issues | No token, no promises, no US entity. Should be fine |
| Someone forks us | Good. More pH balance |

---

## Non-Goals

Things we explicitly don't care about:

- **Being "the best" L2** - We're a meme that works
- **Competing with Base** - We're the punchline, not competition
- **VC funding** - Kills the vibe
- **Rapid scaling** - If it grows, cool. If not, cool.
- **Complex tokenomics** - Keep $ACiD simple
- **Decentralization theater** - Single sequencer until it actually matters

---

## Native Token: $ACiD

**$ACiD is the native gas token from genesis.** Not a memecoin. Not an afterthought. The actual currency of the chain.

Like $OP for Optimism. Like $ARB for Arbitrum. $ACiD for ACiD.

**Why native token from day one:**
- "Do you take ACID?" only hits if it's real money
- Creates actual economy, not just wrapped ETH
- Aligns incentives from genesis
- Makes the meme the money

**Tokenomics:** TBD (keep it simple when we get there)

---

## Decision Log

Decisions to make later, not now:

| Decision | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| $ACiD tokenomics | To define | Keep it simple, avoid VC complexity |
| Decentralized sequencer? | Deferred | Single operator for MVP |
| Superchain membership? | Deferred | Apply if we hit $10M TVL |
| Grants program? | Deferred | Organic growth first |
| Legal entity? | Deferred | Anon launch, formalize if needed |

---

## Getting Started

### For devs joining the project:

1. Clone OP Stack: `git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism`
2. Read their docs: https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started
3. Get local devnet running
4. Change chain ID and branding
5. Deploy to Sepolia
6. Ship bridge UI
7. Tweet

### Mindset:

- This is a side project, not a job
- Ship when ready, no artificial deadlines
- If you're not having fun, take a break
- The meme comes first, tech enables the meme

## FAQ (For the Team)

**Q: What's $ACiD?**
A: The native gas token. Like $OP for Optimism, $ARB for Arbitrum. Pay for everything in $ACiD. "Do you take ACID?" is literal.

**Q: What if Base's lawyers contact us?**
A: "ACID" isn't trademarked. We're not impersonating anyone. We're a chemistry joke.

**Q: What if it actually takes off?**
A: Nice problem to have. Scale infra, maybe do a token, definitely stay weird.

**Q: How do I explain this to people?**
A: "It's an L2 called ACID because there's one called Base. Yes, like pH. Yes, it works."

**Q: What's the long-term vision?**
A: There isn't one. Ship, see what happens, adapt.
