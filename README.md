An Ethereum L2 that exists because Base exists. That's it. That's the pitch.

```
web3 needs pH balance.
```

---

## What Is This?

ACiD is a Layer 2 blockchain forked from the [OP Stack](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) — the same battle-tested foundation that powers Base, Optimism, and others.

We're not here to compete. We're here to coexist.

| | Base | ACiD |
|--|------|------|
| Vibe | Corporate | Alternative |
| Backed by | Coinbase | Anons who get it |
| Optimized for | Human users | AI agents + humans |
| Brand | Professional | Meme with substance |

**You don't drop Base. Just sayin.**

### The Balance Thesis

If you're pro-Base, you should be pro-ACiD. Not competition — chemistry.

```
pH 1  ←───────── 7 ─────────→  pH 14
ACiD            neutral           Base
     ←── both needed for balance ──→
```

We appreciate everything Base and Coinbase have built. We're not here to tear down. We're here to complete the equation. A world with only Base is pH 14 — that's not balanced, that's caustic.

**Base maxis:** Supporting ACiD isn't betrayal. It's equilibrium.

## Why ACiD?

The name does a lot of work:

```
A C i D
│ │ │ │
│ │ │ └── Development
│ │ └──── intelligence (the seeing eye 👁)
│ └────── Crypto
└──────── Artificial

Also:
├── pH balance to Base chain
├── Counter-culture energy
└── AI is literally in the name
```

We're building for the x402 era — where AI agents need rails to transact autonomously. ACiD is permissionless infrastructure for agentic finance.

## Philosophy

```
- Ship first, hype never
- Underpromise, occasionally deliver
- The meme comes first, tech enables the meme
- No roadmap. Don't trip.
- Code-first, visually minded
```

### On Visual Inspiration

Founded by someone with nearly 30 years in art creation, curation, and production — cinematography, music production, visual design. Artist through and through.

**The belief:** Code is just 1s and 0s if it doesn't have visual uniqueness. Web3 has incredible builders who lack visual inspiration. If they were more visually inspired, they'd build happier. Happy builders build better.

ACiD isn't just an L2. It's infrastructure with soul.

**Anyone can build on ACiD.**

**We are not promising:**
- Revolutionary technology (it's a fork)
- Token price appreciation
- Being better than Base
- Changing the world

**We are promising:**
- A working L2
- The joke will land
- It'll be fun to build

---

## Token: $ACiD

**Gas:** ETH (same as Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)
**Native Token:** $ACiD (governance, staking, ecosystem incentives)

Following the industry standard: ETH for gas keeps onboarding simple (everyone already has ETH), while $ACiD serves as the ecosystem token for:

- **Governance** - Vote on protocol decisions
- **Staking** - Secure the network, earn rewards
- **Ecosystem Incentives** - Builder grants, liquidity mining
- **AI Agent Fees** - Premium features for autonomous agents

$OP powers Optimism governance. $ARB powers Arbitrum governance. $ACiD powers ACiD.

---

## Tech Stack

| Component | What We Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| Rollup Framework | OP Stack (Bedrock) |
| Execution | op-geth (EVM compatible) |
| Gas Token | ETH |
| Ecosystem Token | $ACiD |
| Sequencer | Single operator initially |
| Bridge | Standard OP bridge |
| Explorer | Blockscout |

This is Ethereum. If you can build on Base, Optimism, or mainnet, you can build on ACiD.

## Get Involved

We're looking for devs who get it. Not grinders. Not mercenaries. People who see this and think "I fuxx with this."

### What We Need

- **Protocol Devs** — OP Stack, Go, node operators
- **Smart Contract Devs** — Solidity, bridge contracts
- **Frontend Devs** — Bridge UI, explorer customization
- **Designers** — Psychedelic meets minimal
- **Vibe Coders** — If you're reading this, you know

1. Read the [PRD](./PRD.md) — understand the vision
2. Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — how we work
3. Browse [Issues](../../issues) — grab something that calls to you
4. Join the conversation — links below

## FAQ

**Q: Is this serious?**
A: The meme is serious. The tech is serious. The vibes are immaculate.

**Q: Token?**
A: ETH for gas (industry standard). $ACiD for governance and ecosystem incentives. Like how $OP and $ARB work.

**Q: Why should I contribute?**
A: You shouldn't. Unless you get it. Then you should.

**Q: What if it fails?**
A: Then we had fun building something weird. That's enough.
